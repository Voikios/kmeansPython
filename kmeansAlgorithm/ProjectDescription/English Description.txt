K-Means Project

The goal is to write a program that takes the following arguments:
- CSV file with data to be grouped.
- The value of the k parameter.

Implement a k-means algorithm that groups the data in the CSV file into k 
groups. The program should display information about the division into groups, as well as the sum of squares of 
distances inside the clusters after each iteration of the algorithm.

NOTE: The program should work correctly for data with any number of attributes.
